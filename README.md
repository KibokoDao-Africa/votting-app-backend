# Project: Reject Finance Bill

## What Makes It Special

### 1. Tamper Proof
- Uses Web3 technology to ensure each vote is recorded on-chain, where not even the admin can modify it.
- Only one vote per person, since it validates with the National ID before one can vote.

### 2. Ensures Anonymity
- A userID is generated for every user, and that, together with their vote, is what is visible to the public.
